# Синтаксис Mini-Java

Mini-Java is a simplified (and slightly modified) subset of Java. 

Mini-Java programs do not use packages (nor other component/library services). 

All fields are private, and all methods are public.

The main method has no parameters, and is the only "static" method allowed.

Classes have no constructors, and no overloading is allowed in Mini-Java.

The Mini-Java statement ```System.out.println (...)``` can only print integers. 

The Mini-Java construct `e.length` only applies to expressions of type `T []` (where `T` is a type). There are only one-dimensional arrays. Array types are compatible only if they have the same element type. 

Note that `System`, `out`, `println`, `main`, and `length` are here treated as "special literals" (in Java terminology), i.e., you cannot use them as identifiers in Mini-Java programs. 

Mini-Java includes a C-style assert statement (if an assertion fails the system prints out a diagnostic message). 

The void type can only be used as a return type for a method. 

Otherwise, the meaning of a Mini-Java program is given by its meaning as a Java program. 

## КС-грамматика для Mini-Java

The syntax definition is given in so-called Extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF). 
In the following Mini-Java grammar, the notation n*, where n is a symbol, means 0, 1, or more repetitions of the symbol n. 
Parentheses may be used to group together a sequence of related symbols.
Brackets ("[" "]") may be used to enclose optional parts (i.e., zero or one occurrence).
Reserved keywords are marked bold (as "bold").
Operators, separators, and other single or multiple character tokens are enclosed within quotes (as "&&"). 
The syntax given below does not specify the precedence of operators. However, Mini-Java expressions use the same precedences as Java.

## Лексические особенности

* Identifiers: An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, starting with a letter. 
* Uppercase letters are distinguished from lowercase. 
* Integer literals: A sequence of decimal digits is an integer constant that denotes the corresponding integer value. 
* Comments: In a Mini-Java program, a comment may appear between any two tokens. 
* There are two forms of comments: one starts with "/\*", ends with "\*/", can extend over multiple lines, and may be nested. 
* The other comment alternative begins with "//" and goes only to the end of the line.

## Пример программы
```[java]
class Factorial {
  public static void main () {
   System.out.println (new Fac ().ComputeFac (10));
 }
}

class Fac {
  public int ComputeFac(int num) {
   assert (num > -1);
   int num_aux;
   if (num == 0)
    num_aux = 1;
   else 
    num_aux = num * this.ComputeFac (num-1);
   return num_aux;
 }
}
